# Data Analysis & Machine Learning Experiments with Kaggle Datasets

Welcome to the **Data_Analysis_MLE_Kaggle** repository! This repository is a collection of projects where I explore various Kaggle datasets through data analysis and machine learning. Each project is organized in its own folder and includes the complete workflow—from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to model building and evaluation.

## Repository Structure

This repository is designed to be flexible and will grow over time as more datasets and projects are added. For example, current and upcoming projects include:

- **Titanic Dataset**  
  - [Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)  
  A beginner-friendly project that covers data cleaning, feature engineering, and classification using various machine learning models.

- **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques**
  - [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

- **Other Datasets**  
  *(I'll add or update the list below)*
  - [MNIST Handwritten Digits](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)
  - [Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)
